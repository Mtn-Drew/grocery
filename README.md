## Description

On the surface, Smart Grocery is a simple little shopping list app.  But under the hood, it's a full stack CRUD app.  It stores your previously purchased items in a database that is easily searchable, making it easy to add previously purchased items to your latest list.


#### Technologies

Smart Grocery is built with the MERN stack.  This is the first React app I've written with only functional components and React hooks.

- React
- Nodejs
- Express
- MongoDB

## How To Use

Just take Smart Grocery shopping with you.  Click the check mark to cross the item off your list, or click the trash can to delete the item.  When finished shopping, click 'submit' and your purchase will be saved to the database, making it available for searching.

Smart Grocery will sort your shopping list by store, and by aisle description within each store.  You can add or delete preferred stores.  Add an optional description to store or grocery items.  Click on a store or grocery item to see the extra details.

To search, simply start typing in the search box.  All matching items from previously purchased visits will fill the screen, and can be added with a click of a button.
